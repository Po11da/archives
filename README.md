# Ponda's Archives
This repository contains projects I created sometime in the past. Most of them, if not all, were never suposed to be published or used again and as such might be messy, poorly optimized or somewhat wrong. Why not open source them anyway?
Among projects included, there are (or will be) programs written in C++, Python as well as various documents, mainly slide shows to presentations I prepared.
This repository will be updated gradually and slowly as I clean my storage (or not?)
